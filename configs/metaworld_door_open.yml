# ==================== DUAL-AGENT LOOP ARCHITECTURE ====================
n_rounds: 10                     # Increased: 5 rounds is too short for manipulation

# ==================== INITIAL WARMUP ====================
n_trajectories: 200              # Need more initial data to cover the 3D space
n_bootstrap: 50                  # Need better initial reward model
